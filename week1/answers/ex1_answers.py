PART_A_EXPLANATION = """
In Part A, all three prompt formats produced a correct answer. The plain version returned
The Haymarket Vaults, while XML and sandwich returned The Albanach. This shows that on a
strong model with a clean dataset, formatting changed which valid venue was selected, but
did not yet cause a failure.

# ── Part B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The Holyrood Arms was the harder distractor because it matched capacity and vegan requirements
and only failed on availability. A model that skimmed the list instead of checking all three
constraints carefully could easily choose it by mistake.

# Did the exercise run Part C (small model)?

PART_C_XML_ANSWER = "The Haymarket Vaults"
PART_C_SANDWICH_ANSWER = "The Haymarket Vaults"


# Explain what Part C showed, or why it wasn't needed. Minimum 30 words.
PART_C_EXPLANATION = """
Part C ran because Parts A and B were all correct on the larger model. On the smaller 8B
model, all three formats still answered correctly, and all of them chose The Haymarket Vaults.
That suggests the dataset remained easy enough that structural formatting did not create an
observable accuracy gap in this run.
"""

# ── Core lesson ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Complete this sentence. Minimum 40 words.
# "Context formatting matters most when..."

CORE_LESSON = """
Context formatting matters most when the prompt contains many similar options, near-miss
distractors, or a weaker signal-to-noise ratio. In those situations, structure helps the
model separate relevant facts from misleading ones and keep attention on the actual task,
especially for smaller or less capable models.
